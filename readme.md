## Generating handwriting by LSTM, Misture Gaussian & Bernoulli distribution and TensorFlow

TensorFlow implementation of [Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850) by Alex Graves.

This project is adapted from [hardmaru's great work](https://github.com/hardmaru/write-rnn-tensorflow). The `util.py` is just from there and before running `train.py` and `sample.py` you need to follow [the instruction](https://github.com/hardmaru/write-rnn-tensorflow#training) and download the necessary files.

I hope to make this model simple, just **show the main algorithm as clear as possible** without struggling with bundles of optimization methods in deep learning. But if you wish, you can add them easily by yourself.
